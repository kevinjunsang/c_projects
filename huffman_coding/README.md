# Huffman Coding

## Short Dexcription
Program to encode a piece of code to make it smaller and subsequently decode it into the original
text

##Build
Build files
```
clang -Wall -Werror -Wpedantic -Wextra
```
Make both encode and decode functions with
```
make
make all
```
Make encode
```
make encode
```
Make decode
```
maake decode
```

## Running
To run the encode function
```
./encode
```
To run the decode function
``` 
./decode
```

## Errors
I was unable to figure out the io and huffman adt functions
Therefore, I was unable to do the encode and decode main functions
